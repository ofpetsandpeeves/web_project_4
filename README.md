# Project Name: Around The U.S. (but really, world)

### Project Description

This is a project about traveling around the U.S., however I took some liberties on the theme. My spin is that it's a project about dogs traveling around space and the world.

Built to design from a Figma mockup

### Technology and techniques used

* CSS
* Javascript
* BEM methodology (naming conventions and file organizations)
